# LearnRepo
Learning and testing area for GitHub 1st repo.  

This repo is going to be used to test and learn new things about how GitHub works.  
I plan to also get other team members on this for all of our development, design and project development.  We will see how thing work out after a few days/weeks of this.  It is very important that we added versioning tool to our skillset as this will be a theme in our carrer.  Now I'm going to add a few text from the usa today.  

Volvo plans to start selling cars without keys beginning in 2017, using smartphones as replacements.

In effect, Volvo says the Bluetooth-enabled smartphone would become the "digital keys" and there would no longer be a need for physical key.

“Our innovative digital key technology has the potential to completely change how a Volvo can be accessed and shared. Instead of sitting idle in a parking lot the entire day, cars could be used more often and efficiently by whoever the owner wishes,” says Henrik Green, vice president for product strategy at Volvo Cars, in a statement.

If Volvo's plan works, it would become only the latest in a series of moves in recent years that have struck a blow against the traditional metal key. Even the cheapest subcompacts these days often come with electronic key fobs instead of metal keys. Though they can be expensive to replace, the fobs -- in combination with start buttons-- eliminate the danger that a key can become stuck or break off in the ignition lock.
